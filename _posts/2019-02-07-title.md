This blog is part of the __Complex Automaton Base__ (CAB) project. The CAB is a base or framework for computer
simulations. The simulation experiments that can be run by the CAB are called __complex automata__, which are comprised
of a [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) and an
[agent-based system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model).
The CAB is written in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and designed to make creating agent-
based and/or cellular simulations as quick and easy as possible.

In the upcoming posts on this blog I will try and provide insights about
- the fascination with complexity and complex systems,
- creating and exploring complexity with the help of computer simulations
- using the CAB project to quickly get a simulation up and running
- my inspiration for creating the CAB project and my experiences in the (ongoing) development workB

A more detailed description of the CAB project can be found in the [CAB Project](/cab_project/) section.
